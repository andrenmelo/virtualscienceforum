# Organizer Guide

So, you are thinking of organizing a short virtual event. This is easy, rewarding, and takes little work. This manual will guide you through the process.

#### Bird’s eye view of what it takes
Here is a short summary of all the steps you will need to take

- Make a team of organizers
- Decide on a recent and exciting topic
- Write a brief description of the event
- Decide on the scale/format of the event: number of speakers and length of talks
- Make a list of possible speakers to approach
- Decide on a date (should be at least 2 months in the future, so that you can find the speakers and announce the event properly)
- Submit an application to us
- After the time slot is reserved, approach the speakers, invite submissions for contributed talks and posters (if you have them), make a program, and create a webpage
- Advertise the event
- Find the moderators for the talks, ensure that the moderators and the speakers try the software in advance
- Approve participant applications for registration.
- Run the event
- Summarize your experience

#### How the VSF will help you

- We will create a page on our website to advertise your event
- You will be able to run your event through our professional Zoom account (no time limits and capacity for more attendees than regular accounts, 500 instead of 300)
- We will create a registration form for you
- We will advertise your event through our Twitter channel and by emailing the subscribers to our mailing list
- We will give you tips and advice and technical support

#### Basic facts

- We support events of up to 3 hours in a single day (longer events have problems with retention).
- One timeslot can suit only two timezones: America/Europe, Europe/Asia or Asia/America. You can use [this website](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html) to find the timeslot that best suits your needs. 
- Both conventional conference talks of up to one hour (including questions), and 10-15 minute talks work well.
- We require that all the videos are recorded and published on the website after the event.

#### Application form

Apply via a github issue [here](https://github.com/virtualscienceforum/virtualscienceforum/issues/new?assignees=&labels=application&template=application.md&title=Please+specify+the+session+title) (requires a github.com account).

## Detailed instructions

### Planning and application: two months before the event

Choose an organizer team of 2-4 people. Since you will be inviting the speakers and the audience, your team should have good connections in the community. It is also a good idea to find organizers from more than one research group/university.

Decide on the topic of the event. We strongly recommend to focus on recent developments: these make it easier to attract an audience, and you benefit from a shorter waiting period until the conference.

Choose a name for your event. Write a brief explanation of what the topic is, and why it is important. These will eventually go on the event webpage, so try and make them clean and attractive. If possible, prepare a poster-like image to go along with the description.

Make a list of prospective speakers that you plan to approach. Make sure you have a good gender, geographical and seniority balance in your speaker list!

Choose a date and time slot. Try to avoid conflicts with conferences on related topics, major holidays, etc.

Finally, submit the materials that you collected to the VSF. At this stage we aim to accept all applications after basic review (unless the demand is overwhelming).

### Reaching out to the speakers: at least 6 weeks before the event

Once we approved your application and reserved your time slot, you and your co-organizers can start contacting the speakers. The length of your event shouldn't exceed 3 hours, so once you decide the length and format of the talks, adjust the number of speakers accordingly.

You should aim to secure your speakers at least one month prior to your event.

### Finalizing and announcing: 4 weeks before the event

Once your program is complete, we will prepare a page for your event on the VSF website and a registration form for the participants. Now you can start advertising your event.

We will announce the event to anyone signed up to our mailing list and publically through our twitter account, but since you have community connections, you hold the advertising job. Use your resources. For example you can consider:

- Announcing the event to your colleagues via email
- Mentioning it during your travel
- Posting about it on social media

This aspect is not different from traditional conferences: mailing lists, professional contacts, flyers, social media etc. We of course ask you to be considerate and avoid spamming your colleagues.

### Final preparations: 1 week before the event

In the virtual conference setting moderators play a vital role. Find moderators for your event. The [moderator's role](https://virtualscienceforum.org/#/moderatorguide) is demanding, and we recommend finding more than one person to fill it. The moderators should also be familiar with the sesion topic.

Set up an appointment with the speakers and the moderators to introduce them to the platform. 
We can accomodate events with up to 500 participants using the meeting format in Zoom, and up to 1,000 using the webinar format in Zoom. If you have more attendees than these, you can consider streaming the event on the VSF website for those who cannot join the Zoom event, or to select applicants.

### During the event

Make final technical checks shortly before the event starts. By this time you, the moderators, and the speakers should know how the platform works (it’s easy, but requires some preparation).

Give a brief opening and closing speech. In the opening speech, introduce the event, and remind participants of the code of conduct.

### After the event

Review the event page adding the published recordings of the talks. If you like, add any concluding remarks to the page content.

VSF is a newly developed platform, and we welcome your feedback and overall evaluation of your experience. Please write a short summary with your thoughts and suggestions: what worked well, what didn’t, and what would you like to improve.

## Conclusion

That’s all it takes. Let us know if you have any questions, and we’re looking forward to hosting your event!
